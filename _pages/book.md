I'm the author of _Flipped Learning: A Guide for Higher Education Faculty_, coming from [Stylus Publications](https://styluspub.presswarehouse.com) in April/May 2017. I wrote this book because I've been teaching with flipped learning for a while (since 2009) and writing about it on my blog for about the same amount of time; and in the years since I've used flipped learning, I've made a lot of mistakes and figured a lot of things out, and I'm convinced that flipped learning is the way of the future in higher education. I wanted to collect everything I know about flipped learning --- along with some research, theoretical foundations, history, and practical examples --- and put it in one volume, to help more of my colleagues get started and move forward with using flipped learning in their classes. 

In the book, you'll learn: 

+ What exactly is the _definition_ of flipped learning?
+ Who uses flipped learning and why?
+ What's the history of flipped learning, and what questions or problems was it created to address?
+ Is flipped learning backed up by any research? 
+ What are some concrete examples of flipped learning courses across a wide array of disciplines and institutions?
+ Can you flip an online or hybrid course?
+ Can you flip a class with a minimum of technology, including having no videos?
+ How do you design a flipped learning environment, both before the semester starts and on a day-to-day course prep basis?
+ How do I handle situations where students don't do their work? 
+ Should I flip my classroom if I'm untenured? 

There's much more in the book, and I'm really excited to get it into the hands of as many college faculty as possible. You can pre-order it using the link below, and it should hit the shelves in April or May of 2017.
