This week I had a good time talking with Nick Ortego of the [Class Dismissed education podcast](https://classdismissedpodcast.com/). We had a 30-minute conversation mostly about flipped learning, but at the end he gave me a "pop quiz" over a wide range of subjects including my favorite teacher, gift ideas for educators, and the virtues of Sharpie fine-point pens. 

Here's the entire podcast, so enjoy.
