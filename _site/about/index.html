  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I am an Associate Professor in the Mathematics Department at G<a href="http://www.gvsu.edu">rand Valley State University</a> in Allendale, Michigan USA, located in the beautiful <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2006-06-05-michigan_x.htm">west coast area of Michigan</a>. Prior to joining the department at GVSU in 2011, I was on the faculty at <a href="http://www.bethelcollege.edu">Bethel College</a> (Indiana) from 1997–2001 and <a href="http://www.franklincollege.edu">Franklin College</a> from 2001–2011.</p>

<p>My graduate work was in Mathematics at <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/">Vanderbilt University</a> (M.S., 1994 and Ph.D., 1997) under the direction of Efstratios Prassidis in the areas of topology, classical and universal algebra, and category theory. Before going to Vanderbilt, I earned an honors B.S. degree in Mathematics from <a href="http://www.tntech.edu">Tennessee Technological University</a> where I also completed minors in Psychology and English and performed in the concert choir and orchestra.</p>

<p>At GVSU, my work is balanced between teaching, scholarship, and service.</p>

<ul>
  <li>My <em>teaching</em> portfolio is fairly diverse. Recently I have focused on those mathematics courses with a strong connection to computer science. You can read more about my current and recent courses on <a href="/teaching">the Teaching page</a>.</li>
  <li>My <em>scholarship</em> focuses on the scholarship of teaching and learning, particularly those areas that lie <strong>in the intersection of math, technology, and student learning</strong>. You can read more about my current and recent research projects on <a href="/research">the Research page</a>.</li>
  <li>My <em>service</em> activities are balanced between service in the department, to the university, and outside the university. I serve as the Mathematics Department’s Instructional Resources Coordinator (managing all the department’s educational technology assets) and on the Student Affairs committee. University-wide, I currently serve on the Academic Policies and Standards Committee and am chair of the Faculty Teaching and Learning Center Advisory Committee for AY 2015-2016. Outside the university, I am on the organizing commitee for the <a href="http://legacyrlmoore.org/">Legacy of R.L. Moore conference</a> in 2015; on the editorial board of the Fields Mathematics Education Journal; and am currently co-editing an upcoming issue of <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/upri20/current#.VVtZGZNVhBc">PRIMUS</a> on teaching with technology.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2015, I was humbled to receive the <a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/ftlc/pew-teaching-with-technology-award-60.htm">Pew Teaching with Technology Award</a> from GVSU. I was also GVSU’s nominee for Michigan Distinguished Professor of the Year and received the 2015 Distinguished Educator and Service Award from the American Society for Engineering Education Mathematics Division. Here is a short video made by GVSU upon my receipt of the Pew Teaching with Technology Award:</p>

<p>I write about issues concerning mathematics, technology and teaching at my <a href="http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/castingoutnines">blog</a> at the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em>, on <a href="http://google.com/+RobertTalbert">Google+</a>, and on <a href="http://twitter.com/RobertTalbert">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>I live in Allendale with my wife, my three kids, and three cats – 20 minutes from the beach and 20 minutes from Grand Rapids.</p>
