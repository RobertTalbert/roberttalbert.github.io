I just want to give a brief plug for a new book on flipped learning. I played a part in this book and I am very proud of how it turned out. It's called [Best Practices for Flipping the College Classroom](http://amzn.com/1138021733).

This book is an edited volume with contributed chapters from all over the academic landscape. I contributed Chapter 3, on flipped learning in calculus. The other chapters are from practitioners in such fields as nursing, history, marketing, chemistry, and more. 

I really enjoyed working on the chapter in this book, and the editors (Julee Waldrop and Melody Bowdon) did a great job of stitching all the chapters together to form a cohesive whole. Each chapter is formatted in a similar way with an inventory of instructional goals, assessments, and other structural/course design data so that it's easy to compare these flipped approaches across different disciplines. 

Books like this are important: They remind us that flipped learning is not a fad, but rather an increasingly pervasive model of course design and instruction that is spreading across the entire spectrum of academia. It's not just a STEM thing or just something that only a few people do or that only works well in a highly specialized academic setting. I've said before that in five years' time we will not be talking about "the flipped classroom" -- we will just be talking about "the classroom", and flipped learning will be the norm. I feel like this book gives us a glimpse of that near future, maybe not as far off as we might think.
