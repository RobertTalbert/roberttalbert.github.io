**The Monthly Review** is my once-a-month email newsletter for readers of my blog and for anybody else interested in what I do. It contains:

+ A review of the month's blog posts
+ Q&A from readers
+ Snapshots on what's happening in my classes
+ Updates on my writing and speaking
+ Pictures of food and/or cats
+ Other fun stuff

_The Monthly Review_ is the "DVD extras" for the blog that gives you a behind-the-scenes update on what I'm up to. It's just once a month, so it won't spam your inbox. If you're interested in receiving it, just fill out the form below.
