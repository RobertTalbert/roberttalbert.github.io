Statement of Teaching Philosophy
========================================================

Learning is about _relationships_: relationships between ideas, between people, and between people and ideas. The acquisition of content knowledge and domain-specific skills is not, by itself, what constitutes learning. True learning happens when a student articulates a subtle relationship between two disparate ideas; or when she constructs an understanding of an idea based on her own experiences; or when he finds a kindred spirit through the work of a great mathematician, poet, or activist. In other words, the learning happens through, and in, a relationship. If there were one idea that describes my philosophy of teaching, it is that __teaching should strive to create learning environments that enable deep, meaningful relationships__. And if there is one criterion by which I would like my teaching to be evaluated, it is whether or not my efforts in course design and pedagogy have enabled students to form  those relationships. 

Within this overall philosophy, my teaching is organized around four unifying principles. 

First, __students should be active agents in their own learning__. No relationship simply _happens_; rather, all relationships are the result of a combination of presence and activity. In building relationships with people and ideas, students need to work purposefully and with initiative to make sense of concepts, model abstract ideas, draw abstractions from concrete examples, debate disputable statements, and listen to others. In so doing, students come to an understanding of timeless truths in a way that accords with their own experiences. 

Second, __students should focus intentionally on imparting self-regulated learning skills and dispositions__. In higher education, we seek learners who maintain their abilities and tastes for learning throughout their lifetimes. In order to do this, students need to develop the habits of _self-regulating learners_. That is, students should have the disposition to reflect on their thinking and learning, evaluate their progress against an objective standard, and take initiative to change if their progress is insufficient. We often assume these behaviors will simply materialize simply by being exposed to a university environment. My experiences do not corroborate that idea. Rather, in my teaching I seek to inculcate these behaviors by making them part of the DNA of my courses, where students explicitly practice and develop these skills on a daily basis. 

Third, __students should engage early and often with authentic, challenging problems__. Students will develop better both as professionals in their disciplines and as learners in general if they are given problems that have clear intrinsic value and accessible connections to the real world and if they practice the methodology employed by professionals in their disciplines. A problem grounded in an authentic context has an intellectual pull that contrived examples do not have -- even if those problems are messy, ambiguous, and difficult. I seek to give students numerous exposures to these problems to learn the contours of difficult problems, because as emerging professionals those students will be asked to solve such problems, even ones that do not currently exist. 

Finally, __students should use technology intelligently as a tool for making sense of concepts and for constructing a personalized understanding of abstract ideas__. The potential of computing technology as a positive factor in student learning cannot be overestimated. The computer is to the mathematician what the microscope is to the biologist and the telescope is to the astronomer: an indispensible tool for studying phenomena up close and amplifying one's individual intelligence to discover new things and come to terms with abstract ideas. In my classes, I want the computer -- along with its cousins, the tablet and the smartphone -- to play a central role in  students' experience of building a relationship between themselves and the ideas they study. 

I still have a lot to learn about teaching. Teaching is a hard problem whose solutions generate more hard problems -- and as a mathematician who enjoys hard problems, I cannot imagine a better profession than teaching. In fact teaching, for me, is closer to a vocation than a profession. It is a great good to be able to form lasting, positive relationships with students as they themselves deepen their relationships with each other and with ideas. It is also a great honor and an awesome responsibility to play some role in their preparation to live a lifetime of learning.
