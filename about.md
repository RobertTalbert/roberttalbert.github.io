I am an Associate Professor in the Mathematics Department at [Grand Valley State University](http://www.gvsu.edu) in Allendale, Michigan USA, located in the beautiful [west coast region of Michigan](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2006-06-05-michigan_x.htm). Prior to joining the department at GVSU in 2011, I was on the faculty at [Bethel College](http://www.bethelcollege.edu) (Indiana) from 1997--2001 and [Franklin College](http://www.franklincollege.edu) from 2001--2011. 

My graduate work was in Mathematics at [Vanderbilt University](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/) (M.S., 1994 and Ph.D., 1997) under the direction of Efstratios Prassidis in the areas of topology, classical and universal algebra, and category theory. Before going to Vanderbilt, I earned an honors B.S. degree in Mathematics from [Tennessee Technological University](http://www.tntech.edu) where I also completed minors in Psychology and English and performed in the concert choir and orchestra. 

At GVSU, my work is balanced between teaching, scholarship, and service. 

+ My _teaching_ portfolio is fairly diverse. Recently I have focused on those mathematics courses with a strong connection to computer science. You can read more about my current and recent courses on [the Teaching page](/teaching). 
+ My _scholarship_ focuses on the scholarship of teaching and learning, particularly those areas that lie __in the intersection of math, technology, and student learning__. You can read more about my current and recent research projects on [the Research page](/research). 
+ My _service_ activities are balanced between service in the department, to the university, and outside the university. I serve as the Mathematics Department's Instructional Resources Coordinator (managing all the department's educational technology assets) and on the Student Affairs committee. University-wide, I currently serve on the Academic Policies and Standards Committee and am chair of the [Faculty Teaching and Learning Center](https://www.gvsu.edu/ftlc/) Advisory Committee for AY 2015-2016. Outside the university, I am on the organizing commitee for the [Legacy of R.L. Moore conference](http://legacyrlmoore.org/) in 2015; on the editorial board of the [Fields Mathematics Education Journal](http://www.fieldsmathed.com/); and am currently co-editing an upcoming issue of [PRIMUS](http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/upri20/current#.VVtZGZNVhBc) on teaching with technology. 

In 2015, I was humbled to receive the [Pew Teaching with Technology Award](https://www.gvsu.edu/ftlc/pew-teaching-with-technology-award-60.htm) from GVSU. I was also GVSU's nominee for Michigan Distinguished Professor of the Year and received the 2015 Distinguished Educator and Service Award from the [American Society for Engineering Education](http://www.asee.org) Mathematics Division. Here is a short video made by GVSU upon my receipt of the Pew Teaching with Technology Award:

I write about issues concerning mathematics, technology and teaching at [my blog](http://rtalbert.org/blog) (formerly [hosted at the Chronicle of Higher Education](http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/castingoutnines)), on [Google+](http://google.com/+RobertTalbert), and on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/RobertTalbert). 

I live in Allendale with my wife, my three kids, and three cats -- 20 minutes from the beach and 20 minutes from Grand Rapids.
