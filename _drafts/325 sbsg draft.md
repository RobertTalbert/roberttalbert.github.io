Draft -- SBSG in MTH 325 post 

+ Intro -- how long I've been doing this but this is the first time I felt like it worked
+ Overall philosophy: Grade should be based on concrete evidence of...
	+ Mastery of basic skills
	+ Ability in applying basic skills to new problems
	+ Engagement (some can debate this; I want it)
+ The setup
	+ For basic skills: Learning Targets 
	+ for application: Challenge Problems (some theoretical, some programming, some coding but not programming)
	+ For engagement: Lots of stuff but especially Guided Practice and any other actions/activities in the course that I want them to do
+ How each are assessed
	+ Learning Targets -- through short quizzes graded S/U (show example) and through a final exam (to triangulate) 
	+ Challenge Problems -- through writeup using Jupyter notebooks graded EMRN
	+ Engagement -- through engagement credits 
+ Base grade is determined entirely by Learning Targets and Challenge Problems -- show table
+ Modification of base grade determined by ec's and final exam
+ Revision
	+ Learning Targets retaken every other week or through in-office oral revision
	+ CP revised as much as needed, up to two submissions per week -- forces continuous progress and keeps the grading manageable
+ Keeping track with a checklist 
+ How did it go?
	+ The good: SIMPLE (would be simpler without plus/minus grades), keeps student conversation focused on content; transparency, control, no guesswork
	+ The not as good: Students who didn't read syllabus carefully were surprised at the end because they didn't know how the system worked. Really requires having a working knowledge of the system and constant goading to keep up. Also a couple students passed who shouldn't have.
