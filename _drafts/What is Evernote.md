_This is an interlude in the ongoing series **GTD for Academics** that I have been posting. The most recent post (see below) has links to all the posts in the series so far._

[In my last post](http://rtalbert.org/gtd-for-academics-simple-trusted-system/), I went into some (!) detail about _simple trusted systems_ and their use in Getting Things Done (GTD). While GTD is about acquiring good habits of mind and making positive changes to one's behavior about work, having good tools at hand helps to make the habits more habitual. And by "good" we mean _simple_ and _trustworthy_. It shouldn't be hard to learn or use the tools for productivity, and we shouldn't spend much, if any, energy thinking about or messing around with the tools.

I also wrote about using three main tools to do GTD: _Google Calendar_, _ToDoist_, and _Evernote_. These are used, respectively, for calendar items, action lists, and filing away information for later use. There was nothing to say about Google Calendar; I wrote a huge amount about ToDoist. But I wanted to save Evernote until now because the first post was already crazy long, and because a lot of people seem to struggle with how to use Evernote in a consistent way. I know that I did, for a long time. So I'd like to lay out my philosophy and practice of use --- and to defend the concept of paying for Evernote.

## What is Evernote and what does it have to do with GTD?

Evernote can do so many different things in so many different ways, it's hard to describe exactly what it _is_. But here's an attempt. **Evernote is basically a digital filing cabinet**. It functions around the concept of a _note_, which is like a file on your computer, except it's not exactly a file but more like a container. What do you put into this container? Just about anything. Examples:

+ You can create a note and just type text into it, and use it for storing thoughts, drafts of blog posts, meeting notes, etc. It has a reasonably-OK text editor (I would be much happier if it used Multimarkdown) so the experience using it for text is a bit like using Word. 
+ You can create a note and make a recording and store that in the note.
+ You can drag-and-drop other files into a note, like PDFs or images.
+ Evernote offers a browser extension you can use to clip items from the web, and store those as notes.  
+ There are lots of third-party apps that integrate with Evernote, so pretty much anytime you encounter a thing on your computer, there's a pretty good chance you can send it to Evernote from within the app in which you found it.

And once you've created a note, Evernote synchronizes them to a central server and they become accessible on any device with Evernote installed. And it works on basically any device --- macOS, Windows, Android, iOS, and through a web browser. (I don't know if there's a native Linux client yet.) This means that digital stuff that you save to Evernote becomes accessible anywhere you have a digital device.

Much like tasks in ToDoist, notes can have metadata added to them in the form of _tags_. These are labels added to notes that just add information to the notes to help in searching and organizing. You can also add date-based reminders to notes, share notes using public or private links, and collaborate on notes with other Evernote users.   

Evernote organizes notes into _folders_ which are nothing more than collections of notes that you create. Folders can be grouped together too, into what are called _stacks_.

I think the major strength of Evernote, much like the major strength of ToDoist, is its search function. You can search Evernote for any kind of text whatsoever, not only tags and notebooks but also text in the title or body of a note. What's amazing to me is Evernote's OCR capabilities which allow you to search for text within the body of an image. Here's an example from a photo I took of a whiteboard brainstorming session:

The OCR capability is fantastic. One common use of Evernote for me is to scan in paper documents (I like the Scannable app on my iPad), put the PDF or JPG into Evernote, and then shred the original. It makes going almost-paperless very easy, and best of all I can search up these documents later.

Evernote's search is unbelievably fast and accurate. And the power of this search is what makes it so useful for GTD.

In processing habit of GTD, we go through all the stuff that we collected since the last processing session, one item at a time, and decide first whether the item is actionable or not. If it is, then it gets further processed into an action list. But many times, the item is _not_ actionable, and we have to decide whether it should be deleted, filed away, or put into a Someday/Maybe list.

Evernote is a really good choice for the second option, filing away. If the item is not actionable but still useful --- as reference material for an active project, as a record that you want to have available in case it's needed, etc. --- then you can send the item into Evernote and file it away. In case you need it, you can search it up. It works like a filing cabinet with the ability to find the thing you're looking for.

## How I use Evernote

I started using Evernote back around 2010, just a couple of years after it came out of beta. I struggled to find a smooth workflow for using it for a long time. I still think the way I use it is not simple enough, but it's getting there. Here is the setup I use, and the workflow that uses it.

First, I have set up the following notebooks in Evernote:

- A notebook called **+INBOX** that is used for all incoming stuff. (The "+" symbol forces Evernote to keep it at the top of the notebook list.)
- One notebook for each active project that I have going (so, between 20-30 of these at any given time) all collected in a stack called **PROJECTS**.
- A notebook called **Records** for any note that does not belong to a particular project, including notes from projects that have been complete. (As of this writing I have 3134 notes in **Records**.)

There's also a notebook called **Trash** that Evernote puts in automatically that contains all deleted notes.

When I'm processing inboxes, I do exactly as I described above: when an item isn't actionable but it's still potentially useful, I put it into Evernote. The most common way I do this is by forwarding items from my email into Evernote via a special email address (just like you can forward stuff from email to ToDoist). I have it set up so that all emails forwarded to Evernote end up in the **+INBOX** notebook. I can also enter stuff into Evernote by dragging and dropping files onto the Evernote icon in my Macbook's dock, using the web clipper, or using the "Share" button in an app.

Usually once a week at my weekly review time, I go through all the stuff in **+INBOX** and do two things to each note: _add tags_, and then _move the note to its appropriate notebook_.

With tagging, I use a combination of three tags on each note: the _semester_ in which the note was created (for example, w17 is the tag for this semester, Winter 2017), the project to which it belongs (if there is one), and the life area most closely related to it (Teaching, Scholarship, Service, Personal, etc. -- I discussed these in the ToDoist post). The tags just make searching easier. For example, if I'm trying to find an email and I can only remember a few specific things about it, but I happen to know that it happened in Fall 2013, I can add f13 to a search and get better results.

Then once a note is tagged, I move it out of **+INBOX** and into one of two notebooks: If it belongs to a project, it gets moved to the project notebook. If it doesn't, it gets moved to **Records**.

Adding tags and moving it to the right notebook is just a matter of 5-10 seconds of typing in two text fields:

(This is how it works on a Mac. Unfortunately it requires a bit more work on iOS and a lot more work on Android, which is something I wish the Evernote people would change.)

You might be wondering why I tag some notes with their project names _and_ file them away in a project notebook, thereby entering in the same info twice on the same note. I do this because because the notebooks are for _active_ projects. But once a project is done, I still would like to be able to access the notes from that project by name; but I don't want to have the notebook there anymore cluttering up my screen. So when a project is done, I move all of its notes to **Records** and then delete the (now-empty) notebook. The notes are still in the system and accessible by project name, but not in the same place where the active projects are housed.

For example, I often find myself needing to look up a note, and I don't remember exactly what I titled it, but I do remember it was from the Fall 2015 version of MTH 325 or from an NSF grant that I worked on in 2012. With that much info I can search up the tag And usually find it fairly quickly.

In reality, none of these notebooks or tags are really even necessary because of how good Evernote's search function is. If I can just remember the first or last name of a student who sent me an email in 2014 about a thing with MTH 325, I can search under the name and "mth 325" and find it quickly. The tags and notebooks just make it cleaner and the searches more foolproof. That's why I am OK with dumping all my non-actionable stuff into **+INBOX** and leaving it there, and only processing it once a week. If I need something, I can usually find it just with a search and don't need the tags so much.

So Evernote forms the third leg of my GTD tripod, as it were. Google Calendar is for date-related stuff; ToDoist is for action lists; Evernote is where I put stuff that I might need to reference.
