This page serves as my main faculty contact page for students and colleagues at Grand Valley State University.

**I will be on sabbatical from GVSU during the entire academic year 2017--2018.** During this time I will not be teaching and I will mostly not be on campus. I will also not be on campus during Spring or Summer 2017. For complete information about my sabbatical, please see [the Sabbatical page](http://rtalbert.org/sabbatical).

If you are a student and you need to contact me between May 2017 and August 2018:

+ **If you're one of my academic advisees**, please note that you should be temporarily reassigned to a different advisor for the 2017--2018 academic year. You can direct any advising questions you may have either to that person or to the CLAS Advising Center. If it's a request that only I can fulfill, then please feel free to contact me.
+ **If you need a letter of recommendation**, please go ahead and contact me, but I will need at least two weeks' notice to write the letter. Requests that come in with less than two weeks before the deadline will be declined.
+ **If you are a GVSU student with a general question about the Mathematics Department or a course**, please direct your question to either Sandra Snyder or Jan Kuzee, administrative assistants for the Mathematics Department.
