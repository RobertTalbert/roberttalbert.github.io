__For information on my speaking and consulting, please go to [my Speaker page](http://rtalbert.org/speaking).__

I'm Robert Talbert, and I am an Associate Professor in the Mathematics Department at [Grand Valley State University](http://www.gvsu.edu) in Allendale, Michigan USA. 

As a professor, I teach courses mainly for computer scientists (discrete structures, linear algebra, cryptography) and I also teach our department's online Calculus course in the summers. My current and upcoming classes are: 

+ __Spring/Summer 2016:__ MTH 201 (Calculus), Section 02 (online)
+ __Fall 2016:__ MTH 225 (Discrete Structures for Computer Science 1), Sections 01 and 02; MTH 325 (Discrete Structures for Computer Science 2), Section 01
+ __Winter 2017:__ MTH 225 (Discrete Structures for Computer Science 1), Section 03; MTH 325 (Discrete Structures for Computer Science 2), Sections 02 and 03

I do research primarily in the scholarship of teaching and learning, focusing on flipped learning, alternative grading practices, and teaching with technology. For a comprehensive list of my publications, [please see my _curriculum vitae_](/assets/TalbertCV-2016a.pdf) [PDF]. 

I'm the author of _Flipped Learning in the University: A User's Guide_, coming from Stylus Publishing in 2017. 

You can read more of what I'm thinking about, at my blog [Casting Out Nines](http://rtalbert.org/blog). 

I live in Allendale, 20 minutes from Grand Rapids and 20 minutes from the beaches of Lake Michigan with my wife, three kids and three cats.
