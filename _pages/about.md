Hi there. I'm Robert Talbert and welcome to my website.

I am a Professor in the [Mathematics Department](http://www.gvsu.edu/math/) at [Grand Valley State University](http://www.gvsu.edu/) in Allendale, Michigan USA. In this position I teach 2-3 classes a semester, conduct research (mostly in the teaching and learning of undergraduate mathematics, but sometimes in pure mathematics), and serve the university and the broader community in a number of ways.

My undergraduate degree is in Mathematics from [Tennessee Technological University](https://www.tntech.edu/). My Ph.D. degree is in Mathematics from [Vanderbilt University](http://www.vanderbilt.edu) (1997) where I studied algebraic topology, homological algebra, and category theory under the direction of [Efstratios Prassidis](http://myria.math.aegean.gr/~stratos/). Prior to GVSU, I was on the faculty at [Bethel College (Indiana)](https://www.bethelcollege.edu/) and [Franklin College](http://franklincollege.edu/). 

I'm active as a speaker and consultant in the areas of __flipped learning__, __teaching with technology__, __self-regulated learning__, and other areas. To learn more about my speaking and consulting, please head over to my [Speaking page](http://rtalbert.org/speaking/).

The main page of this website contains blog articles, all of which are on some linear combination of mathematics, technology, teaching, and productivity. This blog is the latest incarnation of my former blog __Casting Out Nines__, which began in 2006 and spent 2011---2015 as a featured blog at the _Chronicle of Higher Education_. The old articles from the _Chronicle_ days are not posted here but rather are archived at the _Chronicle_. [You can access those here](http://www.chronicle.com/blognetwork/castingoutnines/) and then search for what you're looking for.

To contact me, please use any of the email or social media contacts in the sidebar.

To learn a little more about me and my teaching approach, here's a short video that was made by GVSU when I won the Pew Teaching With Technology award in 2015.
