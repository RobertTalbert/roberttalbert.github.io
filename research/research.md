My research and writing projects are mainly focused on the scholarship of teaching and learning, particularly on flipped learning and the integration of technology in university mathematics courses. I also continue to work in pure mathematics; although trained as an algebraic topologist, my mathematical work has focused on cryptography and some aspects of theoretical computer science. 

### Current projects

+ __Marcia Frobish__ (Mathematics, GVSU) and I are analyzing data collected from 10 sections of Calculus 1 during Fall 2014 to measure progress in students' conceptual understanding of calculus and their self-regulated learning behaviors across the semester. 
+ __Amy Schelling__ (Education, GVSU) and I are currently planning a study to be run in Fall 2015 to examine the effects of flipped learning on students with documented learning disabilities. 
+ My paper _Technology as a tool for self-regulated learning in an inverted calculus course_ is currently being submitted to journals. 
+ I am working on a reading and self-study project to learn about the [Haskell programming language](https://www.haskell.org/) and its theoretical basis, the \(\lambda\)-calculus. 

### Upcoming publications

+ _Flipped Calculus: A Gateway for Lifelong Learning in Mathematics_ -- Book chapter to appear in [Best Practices in Flipping the College Classroom](http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9781138021730/), Routledge Press. 
+ _Inverting the transition-to-proof course_ will appear in an upcoming issue of _PRIMUS: Problems, Resources, and Issues in Undergraduate Mathematical Studies_.
+ My paper with Beth Bjorkman, _Fixed points of columnar transposition ciphers_, will appear in an upcoming issue of _Journal of Discrete Mathematical Sciences and Cryptography_.
