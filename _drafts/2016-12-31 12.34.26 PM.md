_This is a summary of my talk "Computational thinking in undergraduate discrete mathematics using Python and Jupyter notebooks" given at the Joint Mathematics Meetings this week, along with some additional thoughts on the subject._ 

I've been teaching a steady diet of discrete mathematics for the last few years, and I think there's a special place in this subject for a way of looking at problem solving known as __computational thinking__. [I've written about computational thinking once before and its relationship to flipped learning](http://rtalbert.org/blog/2015/computational-thinking-guided-practice) but computational thinking works in discrete mathematics in all forms of instruction. As a reminder, computational thinking is a problem Solving approach in which problems are approached in four phases:

1. **Decomposition**, where the problem is broken down into parts and each part analyzed separately;
2. **Pattern recognition**, where the problem-solver discerns relationships between the parts;
3. **Abstraction**, where the problem-solver comes up with an explanation that distill the pattern she sees into a clear, correct observation or conjecture; and 
4. **Algorithm design**, where the problem-solver devises a method or procedure for the solution. 

For mathematics, in the last stage I believe we can consider the term _algorithm_ -- which doesn't always describe the final product of a problem solution -- as being on equal footing with the terms _solution_, _explanation_, and _proof_. 

This approach to problem solving immediately sounds familiar to those who learn and do mathematics. What is it about discrete math
