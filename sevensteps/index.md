### Seven Steps to Flipped Learning Design

>I never teach my pupils. I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn. -- _Albert Einstein_

Creating meaningful lessons, especially in a flipped learning environment, is hard work! It takes experience -- and the ability to learn from mistakes -- to be able to prepare rich, meaningful learning experiences without taking too much time. It helps to have a _framework_ and _guidance_. 

This is why I wrote a short, free booklet called __Seven Steps to Flipped Learning Design: A Workbook__. This workbook will walk you through seven steps for creating an effective flipped lesson, in a way that is simple, streamlined, and easy to master. The seven steps are: 

1. Come up with a minimal but comprehensive list of learning objectives for your lesson. 
2. Remix the learning objectives so that they appear in order of cognitive complexity. 
3. Do a rough design of the in-class activity you intend students to do. 
4. Go back to the learning objectives list, and split it into Basic objectives (to be addressed by student prior to class) and Advanced objectives (to be addressed by the class as a whole during and following class). 
5. Finish the design of the in-class activity. 
6. Design and construct the pre-class activity. 
7. Design and construct any post-class activities.  

Modeled after the Guided Practice system I've used in my flipped classes since 2009, and written for use in [the workshops on flipped learning that I give](http://rtalbert.org/speaking/), _Seven Steps to Flipped Learning Design_ is the result of a long process of trial and error with designing flipped lessons in university mathematics and computer science courses along with a dash of the best research on the scholarship of teaching and learning. My hope is that by using this method, you'll create a sustainable workflow for lesson preparation in a flipped learning environment that consistently produces great learning experiences and frees your mind up to work with your students. 

The book is in a constant state of update, so check back often.
