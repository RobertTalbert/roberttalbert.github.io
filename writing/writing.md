Writing has been one of my passions since I was in high school, when I hung out in the woods behind my house with a notebook writing bad poetry. These days my writing is less bad, and no longer poetry (most of the time) but focused on teaching, learning, and technology. 

Here are some of the writing projects with which I'm currently involved: 

+ [I maintain my blog Casting Out Nines at this site](http://rtalbert.org/blog). It was formerly hosted by the Chronicle of Higher Education, and you can search through the archives from 2006--2015 [there](http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/castingoutnines). 
+ I am a contributor to [Wired Campus](http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/), an online publication of the Chronicle of Higher Education on technology in higher ed. 
+ I'm currently at work on the manuscript for my first book, __Flipped Learning in the University Classroom: A User's Guide__ for [Stylus Publishing](https://styluspub.presswarehouse.com/Books/Features.aspx), which should appear in 2016. 
+ I wrote the e-book [Seven Steps to Flipped Learning Design: A Workbook](http://rtalbert.org/sevensteps) as a resource for participants in the [workshops on flipped learning](http://rtalbert.org/speaking/) that I give, and I decided to open it up to the general public. 
+ Somewhat rarely I will post stuff on [Medium](https://medium.com/@RobertTalbert). 
+ You can also read my status updates on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/RobertTalbert) and [Google+](http://google.com/+RobertTalbert).
