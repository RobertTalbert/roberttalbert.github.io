Chromebook report outline

- What happened
    + Purchased a Chromebook Pro in December
    + Wanted to see how well it stood up to everyday work so I used it as my primary machine -- started off with plan to use it for a week. Ended up going for six weeks and still using it. 
    + TLDR: It's a great machine, so far works for 90% of what I do. Still need the Macbook Pro for the other 10% but that may be changing. 
    + This is the first of ongoing irregular series on Chromebook use in academia. 
- My background with Chromebooks
    + First: Samsung 1st generation for kids -- basically a netbook, not very useful but good for what it was
    + Second: Acer models for math dept -- noticeably more powerful and better looking. (Went on to buy 30 more a year later.)
    + Third: Kids getting them in school, HP models 
    + Fourth: Replace Samsung with Lenovo -- first one to have the Play Store. 
        * Play Store: The utility of having Android apps on the Chromebook cannot be overstated. It was at that point that I "got it". 
    + Last year, a round of "professional grade" Chromebooks from Samsung and Google. Not sure $999 was worth the investment so picked up Pro (cheap thanks to sales) to use as proof of concept. 
- What I've been doing
    + At Steelcase -- bringing in the CBP to use as my primary work machine. 
    + Writing
        * Google Docs 
        * Caret 
        * StackEdit -- Maybe my final solution. 
    + Research
        * Google Scholar
        * Mendeley android app
        * Mendeley web app 
    + Email and scheduling
        * Outlook all day/every day -- android app works reasonably well, some quirks. 
    + Productivity
        * Todoist -- several apps and they all work great
        * Evernote -- Android app is so-so; web interface is surprisingly great
        * OneNote -- sigh
    + Presentations
        * Big Google Slides fan already and this is the best approach on a CB. 
        * PowerPoint -- it works but it's weird because of Office 365. 
    + Communication (esp videoconferencing)
        * The CBP itself does OK but the software sucks. 
        * Skype for Business, WebEx are terrible
        * Zoom -- the only tool I've found that halfway works 
    + Blogging
        * Using Jekyll, so I write posts in Markdown (above) and then push to Github. 
        * No solutions for Github that are close to the Github desktop client on Mac or using the terminal. 
        * StackEdit will push to Github if you pay for an annual subscription. 
        * Otherwise, it's pretty OK just to use the Github web interface. 
        * Note: There is no real terminal access unless you go into dev mode which removes the security layer. Hopeful this changes with Linux Vms coming this year. 
    + Coding
        * Jupyter notebooks: No really great solutions yet. CoCalc -- good but needs suscriptions. No native client unless you want to do crouton (below). Settling for now on Microsoft Azure which seems good enough. 
        * LaTeX: Same. Using Overleaf for now but really want a native solution for offline use. 
- Major plusses
    + Incredibly light, thin, fast and the screen is awesome and the 2-in-1 is great.
    + Handwriting is somethign I didn't know I needed -- interacting with the computer in multiple ways
    + Little touches like the keyboard shortcut map, dedicated physical buttons for forward/back/reload
    + Super simple and secure 
    + Didn't realize just how much of my work can be/is done on the web 
    + Android apps in general: Most work. Some work well. Others don't work at all. It's a process and I think it'll get better (if Google pushes it... which who knows)
- Major issues
    + Connecting to legacy/enterprise systems like campus VPN don't work 
    + Printing
    + No real file system
    + Cannot put complex stuff on the local machine (Anaconda, etc.)
    + Hidden expenses in the form of subscriptions
    + Android apps are a work in progress
- My take
    + The CBP works shockingly well for the vast majority of stuff I do as an academic. 
    + It's inexpensive, light, and shockingly capable. Build quality of the CBP is not the greatest. 
    + The minority of stuff where it doesn't work well, there's no good workaround. Maybe this will change with Linux Vm's coming this year.
    + So my setup right now is using the CBP for the 80%, and keeping my 2016 Macbook Pro for the other 20%. 
    + In the summer I am up for an upgrade. Had planned on replacing the Macbook with something, but thinking of keeping it and going for the top-model Pixelbook instead.
