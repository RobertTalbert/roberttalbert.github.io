_This is the first in a weekly series of articles here that I call "Sanity Check". I hope to post these  every Tuesday, with articles on profhacks, tips on productivity and wellness, and ways for professors (and teachers of all sorts) to save time, be happy, and keep ourselves from burnout._

Part of good course design as we start a new semester means looking ahead in the term to look for potential problems and bottlenecks in our courses, and as much as possible, devise some solutions to those problems before classes start. One aspect of a course we have to consider is _how to give feedback to students_. This means a lot more than just _grading_ --- it means giving students the information they need, when they need it. And one of the most in-demand items of information for student during a course is how soon you'll be handing back graded work.

We've all been there, with emails or after-class questions from students wanting to know whether we've finished grading a test. Wanting to know when you'll be done grading a piece of work is a legitimate request, but it can quickly turn into nonstop pestering from students who simply want to know where they stand in the course. A normally sane professor can crack under the constant questioning.

A couple of years ago I stumbled upon a way to give students this information on demand, without a single email involved, and it helped me keep more organized and forward-looking with my grading schedule in the process. It involves a fantastic web tool called [Trello](http://trello.com).

Trello is a tool that is so simple and universal it's hard to describe exactly what it _is_, because it can be used in a thousand different ways. At its heart, Trello is an organizational tool that uses the [kanban system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) of organization and project management, used in Japanese corporations, to visually arrange items in the form of _cards_ that are placed into vertically-oriented groupings called _lists_. The cards can be moved from one list to another, like post-it notes arranged on a whiteboard. Trello boards can be used for everything from tracking progress on software development projects to planning your wedding or keeping track of reading lists.

I had been using Trello to keep track of my grading tasks in my courses: What I need to get done, what's next in line to get done, what I'm currently working on, and what's been done. And one day I realized that this information is precisely what the students were asking me (over and over again) for. So I decided to create a __grading status board__ and release it to the public for everyone, especially my students, to see. Here's what it looks like right now, on the eve of the beginning of Winter semester:

There's nothing on it of course, because there's nothing to grade right now. (I'll look back on this time with great fondness later.) But note the structure, with lists for _How to use this board_, _To Do_, _Next Up_, _Current Sprint_, _In Progress_, and _DONE_. If you look in the information list and click on the top card (which you can go ahead and do, if you follow the link) it "flips over" and there are instructions on how to use the board:

Now I'm going to give you step-by-step instructions for setting one of these up for yourself.

First, go to http://trello.com and sign up for a (free) account. You can just sign in using Google if you prefer, or enter your email and a password. Once you are in, create the board and call it "Grading Status" or whatever you like. It will look blank like this:

Now we're going to create six lists: _Information_, _To Do_, _Next Up_, _Current Sprint_, _In Progress_, and _DONE_. Make sure to arrange them in that order from left to right (although some people like to put the Information list at the far right; suit yourself!). You can click and drag lists to reorder them.

Now we add cards to the lists. To create a card in a list, just click on "Add a card..." in the list you want and start typing, then hit Enter or click Add when done:

A big strength of Trello is the ability to add information and "stuff" to cards. Clicking on the card will flip it over and there you can add information. For example, here I'll add a description (the text field uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which is another reason to like Trello) and attach a file.

You can also attach pictures and files to cards after you create them, just by dragging and dropping onto the card.

Next, I find it helpful to create _labels_ that add some metadata to the cards. I create a different label for every section that I am teaching, along with a red label for cards that are currently with my student grader so students will know I don't have them. You can create labels by going to the menu in the top right:

For now, you can add cards to the Information list that students will use to navigate the board. Later, as graded work comes pouring in (sigh...) __create a new card in the To Do list for each item to grade__. Here's a workflow that I recommend that will make your life easier in this regard:

First, create the card in the To Do list and type in the name of the item you are grading. You can also add labels to the card when you make it by using the hashtag symbol. Here's an example of creating a bunch of these cards:

(gif adding homework 1, quiz 1, test)

__And now a very important step: If the graded item is big, break it down into small pieces by adding a checklist to the card.__ One mistake a lot of professors make in grading is thinking that a graded item like "Grade Test 1" is a single thing, a single point on a to do list. But it isn't. Grading a test is not a _task_, it's a _project_, that consists of a lot of smaller tasks that can be done piecemeal if needed. For example, that "Test 1" that I added to the board might be for a class with 75 students in it. If I conceive of that Test as a single task, I'll never get it done because my brain rebels against the idea of the amount of time and effort it will take, and I'll get discouraged because I've worked for hours and hours and it's _still not done_.

Instead, what I should do is __break that into a bunch of discrete tasks__ each of which can be done in a reasonable amount of time. For example, I could think of that Test as being a project with 5 tasks in it: "Grade students 1--15", "Grade students 16--30", "Grade students 31--45", "Grade students 46--60", and "Grade students 61--75". I may not have the time to sit down and grade 75 papers all at once; but grading 15 papers is only 20% of the work and I can fit that into a smaller window of time in my schedule. _Treating grading tasks as projects and not tasks, and then breaking these down into manageable chunks of grading_ is probably the biggest single sanity-saving hack I've discovered in the last 10 years of teaching because I can use smaller windows of time, and commit to small windows over a few days rather than staying up late or working on the weekends because that's all the time I think I have.

Trello makes this decomposition of grading tasks easy by allowing you to add _checklists_ to cards. Here for example is me adding a checklist to the Test 1 card:

You have now built your board and populated it with stuff to do and information on how to use it. The last thing to do is set the visibility to "Public" so that your students can see it.

Here's how to use the grading status board during the semester. This is based on how I use mine:

+ Look at the to-do list and decide on the 1--3 items that you intend to do next, and then move them to the Next Up list. (You do this just by clicking and dragging the card from one list to the other.) __Only have 1--3 items in the Next Up list at any given time.__ This helps you focus on next actions, rather than get bogged down in the giant backlog of stuff to do.
+ When you are working on a single specific item, move it to the Current Sprint list. This is the place for items you are working on at that very moment.
+ As you grade, check off the subtasks in the checklist for this item as you complete them, if the item has a checklist.
+ If you make progress on an item (say you grade students 1--30 of that 75-student class, but not everyone) but have to quit grading before you are completely done, move the item to the In Progress list, which is for items that are underway but not done yet. Move it back to the Current Sprint list when you resume working on them. (Most graded items will bounce between these two lists for days until they're done.)
+ Optional: If you have to stop while a grading item is in progress, you can click on the card to leave a comment for students about its current status if you feel students may need more info.
+ Once you finish an entire item, move it to the DONE list and celebrate!
+ Repeat this during the semester, adding new items to the To Do list, populating the Next Up list, etc. throughout the week.

Make sure to give the link to your grading status board out to students on the first day of classes and take a minute to explain or demonstrate it. I put the link for mine prominently on the course Blackboard site. And if a student forgets and sends you an email or catches you after class to ask whether you're done grading something, just ask them, "Did you check the grading status board?" Sometimes students may need help understanding it; others have just forgotten that it's there, and need reminding.

My students and I have found the grading status board to be a great time-saver and organizational tool. For me, I use the grading status board as my actual grading task list; I have an IFTTT automation set up that creates a task in ToDoist whenever I add a card to the To Do list on the board. For students, they benefit from real-time updates on your progress --- their view will sync almost instantly with yours, so they'll even "see" you move cards around --- and that's one less thing for them to think about, and a little more mental space to devote to learning the concepts in your course.

I encourage you to give this a try this semester, and I hope it helps your sanity if you do.
