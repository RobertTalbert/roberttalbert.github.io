    <p>In addition to my duties as a professor, I serve as a speaker and consultant to a variety of audiences on teaching and learning, especially university mathematics education, the flipped classroom, and the integration of technology in mathematics teaching and learning. My experiences range from small-group intensive workshops with high school calculus teachers and two-year college STEM faculty, to international keynote presentations and webinars.</p>
