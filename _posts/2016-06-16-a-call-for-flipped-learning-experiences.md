As readers know, I am writing a book called _Flipped Learning in the University_ that is going to the publisher in September. I've just finished up writing a lengthy chapter on the history of flipped learning, a survey of research about flipped learning, and an overview of the psychological theory behind flipped learning. Any sane person, after going through that chapter, would want to see some real-life examples of where actual professors use flipped learning in their classrooms. For this, I would like to recruit the internet. 

So, I am putting out a call for any college or university faculty member who uses flipped learning in his or her class, to any degree (even if you flip just part of a class), to send me some information about what you do. By "college or university" I include any kind of four-year college that's out there _and_ community/two-year institutions --- but not high schools, because the book is oriented toward higher education. By "faculty member" I mean anybody who teaches: full-time tenure-track people as well as non-tenure track and adjunct faculty members as well. And by "flipped learning" I mean anything that fits the following definition: 

>__Flipped Learning is a pedagogical approach in which first contact with new concepts moves from the group learning space to the individual learning space in the form of structured activity, and the resulting group space is transformed into a dynamic, interactive learning environment where the educator guides students as they apply concepts and engage creatively in the subject matter.__

If you teach a face-to-face in-seat class (not online) then "group space" = "in class" and "individual space" = "outside of class". (This definition is a recent modification of mine, based on [the one at FlippedLearning.org](http://www.flippedlearning.org/definition) and I may have more to say about it in another post.)

What I'd like to hear from you, is: 

+ The reasons why you chose to use flipped learning in your class; 
+ What students in your class do during the "group space" and the "individual space"; and 
+ Any evidence of effectiveness of flipped learning you may have, including anecdotal (student comments, etc.) 

Also: __I especially would like to hear from people not in mathematics or statistics.__ Back in November I tweeted out a request very similar to this and got several responses, only one of which was from someone outside of math or statistics. I know that flipped learning is used in a variety of disciplines and I want to showcase that variety as much as I can. 

So here's what to do if you are interested in helping out. __Just write up your responses to the three points above; give your name, institution, and the name of the course; add in anything else you'd like to say about what you are doing; and then send it to me in an email to talbertr@gvsu.edu by July 15.__ The deadline is because the book is due by September and I'll need time to edit all the responses together. In response, you'll have your story featured prominently in Chapter 3 of the book. 

Thanks in advance!
