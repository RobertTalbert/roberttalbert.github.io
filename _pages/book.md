I'm the author of _Flipped Learning: A Guide for Higher Education Faculty_, coming from [Stylus Publications](https://styluspub.presswarehouse.com) in April/May 2017. I wrote this book because I've been teaching with flipped learning for a while (since 2009) and writing about it on my blog for about the same amount of time. During that time I've made a lot (!) of mistakes and figured a lot of things out. I wanted to collect everything I know about flipped learning --- along with some research, theoretical foundations, history, and practical examples --- and put it in one volume. I'm convinced that flipped learning is the way of the future in higher education and I want to give faculty in all walks of higher ed a handbook for how to get started and keep going.

In the book, you'll learn:

+ What exactly is the _definition_ of flipped learning?
+ Who uses flipped learning and why?
+ What's the history of flipped learning, and what questions or problems was it created to address?
+ Is flipped learning backed up by any research?
+ What are some concrete examples of flipped learning courses across a wide array of disciplines and institutions?
+ Can you flip an online or hybrid course?
+ Can you flip a class with a minimum of technology, including having no videos?
+ How do you design a flipped learning environment, both before the semester starts and on a day-to-day course prep basis?
+ How do I handle situations where students don't do their work?
+ Should I flip my classroom if I'm untenured?

There's much more in the book, and I'm really excited to get it into the hands of as many college faculty as possible.
