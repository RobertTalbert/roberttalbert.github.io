Take for example the classic beginning problem in set theory:

>Given a finite set with $n$ elements, how many subsets does it have?

The answer is: $2^n$. We _could_ simply tell students this fact and give them some reason to believe it. But it's a much more powerful thing to have students explore it on their own. And a computational thinking-oriented approach would look something like this:

1. _Decomposition_: Look at a few examples. What about the set $\{a\}$? Can we generate all its subsets? What about $\{a, b\}$? What about $\{a,b,c\}$? What about the empty set?  (Answers are 2, 4, 8, and 1 respectively.) What about others? These are all easy questions to compute and check.
2. _Pattern finding_: Is there a pattern among the individual instances you computed? What if we made a table?
3. _Abstraction_: Can you put your observation into a concise, tight, clear, and correct mathematical statement? (Sure we can: _For all nonnegative integers $n$, a set with $n$ elements has $2^n$ subsets._ It might take an iteration or two to realize you have to quantify the variable properly.)
