Previously: Collect, process, plan
	Collected stuff
	Processed it into actionable items and put into lists

Most important part -- Doing

Do one task at a time, without distractions. This is one of the most important habits in ZTD. You must select a task (preferably one of your MITs) and focus on it to the exclusion of all else. First, eliminate all distractions. Shut off email, cell phone, Internet if possible (otherwise just close all unnecessary tabs), clutter on your desk (if you follow habit 2, this should be pretty easy). Then, set a timer if you like, or otherwise just focus on your task for as long as possible. Don't let yourself get distracted from it. If you get interrupted, write down any request or incoming tasks/ info on your notepad, and get back to your task. Don't try to multi-task.

Sounds simple but it's harder than it looks
	Distractions
	Multitasking
	Perceived lack of time compounded by failure to plan. And know what the big rocks/MIT's are
	(Constantly doing only the urgent stuff -- putting out fires) 

How I do:
	The early morning block
	Block off time for BigRocks duringthe week, give myself permission not to work on other stuff (Grading is important and that's why I set aside 2 hours on Thursday morning to get it done; family is important and that's why I dedicate 6-9pm every night for family and don't check email between 6 and 6; sleeping is important and that's why I get off screens by 8pm and get into bed by 10pm.) 
	During the blocks -- Shut the door, close email and Twitter, get clutter off the desk, and give myself time limitations (50 minutes). If I get interrupted, make a note and move on. When done, get up and move and reward myself (10 minutes). Also no eating during this time (mindless eating).  
	Give myself permission not to get certain things done. Example - I do not have to get all my grading done within 3 days. I do not have to grade papers after 7pm or on the weekends. As long as I know what the MITs and big rocks are and am getting those done, this is OK

Example: Typical Monday
- Wake at 5
- 5:15-6 -- Morning work block, one MIT or a significant piece of it
- 6-7 -- exercise and clean up
- 7-8 -- breakfast and kids on the bus
- 8:30-9 -- Check email 
- 9-11 -- teach. 
- 11-12 -- Office hour. Work on tasks that are in the next actions lists but NOT any MIT's because I am working with students sometimes. 
- 12-1 -- Flex time. If I feel like work, then use it as time for an MIT. Or a bunch of smaller things on the lists. If I don't feel like working, go for a walk. 
- 1-2 -- Sometimes blocked out for meetings. Otherwise a work hour. 
- 2-3 -- Office hour, see above. 
- 3-4:30 -- Usually block off 3-4 to work on service stuff, 4-4:30 to clear inboxes and do small tasks. 
- 4:45 -- Close up shop and do no work until tomorrow. 

Typical Tuesday -- completely open
- Big blocks of time for bigger tasks -- prep and grading especially
- Box it off into one-hour blocks, work for 50 minutes then break for 10. Repeat from 9 through 4:30. 

This pattern of work works for me. I don't typically carry work home over the weekends or in the evenings although I could if I wanted -- I just don't want to because rest and family. 

How to make work fit into the time that we have?
	Be focused and avoid distractions
	Have a sense of what you need to do and what's important (see first three habits)
	Say no to stuff 
	Delegate
