Teaching is my primary responsibility and my greatest interest. My approach to teaching is based on the idea that __teaching and learning are about relationships:__ relationships between people, between ideas, and between people and ideas. My role as a teacher is to create rich environments that provide meaningful learning opportunities for all students, and to serve as a guide and coach as students work through those environments. [Here is a longer version of my teaching philosophy](/sotp/). 

Of particular interest to me in the area of teaching are __flipped learning__ and __the inverted classroom__, the use of __specifications grading__, and the __integration of computing and mathematics__.
