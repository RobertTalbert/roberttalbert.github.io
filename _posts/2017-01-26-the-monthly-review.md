Ever since starting to blog way back in the early 2000's, I've been fascinated by the power of online communities. My blogs back in those days --- out of which the current one evolved --- were my attempt to reach out to the rest of the world and share what I was doing in the classroom and in life, to look for like-minded people who could help me learn and grow. And the crazy thing was, it worked. Over ten years later, I'm still blown away by the fact that I can put ideas out there for people to discuss, and not only do I get that discussion, I get a _community_.

That ongoing love of online community among people who care about the things I write about --- math, technology, education, productivity, and more --- is why I'm very excited to announce a new venture in that direction, a monthly newsletter called _The Monthly Review_.

_The Monthly Review_ is an email newsletter that I intend to send out once a month. The name is a play on the name of a GTD practice, [the weekly review](http://lifehacker.com/5908816/the-weekly-review-how-one-hour-can-save-you-a-weeks-worth-of-hassle-and-headache). In _The Monthly Review_, you'll find:

- Recaps of (and links to) the blog posts from the previous month
- Reports from my speaking and workshop events, and previews of upcoming ones
- Summaries of what's going on in my teaching, and the stuff I'm doing in the classroom that doesn't make it into a blog post
- More productivity tips and tricks
- Q&A from reader emails
- Pictures of smoothies and cats
- More!

Basically I would like the newsletter to be a way for me to connect even more closely with those of you who take the time and effort to read my blog or follow my Twitter stream. But, unlike blog comments or tweets, I feel like the long-form approach to online interaction is the best form. I'm hoping that the newsletter becomes something like that.

You can sign up just by going to [https://tinyletter.com/rtalbert](https://tinyletter.com/rtalbert) and putting in your email, or using the form below. I promise it's only going to be once a month --- I even built it into the title! I'll probably send the first one out around February 1.

I'm looking forward to connecting more with you.
