I'm heading out of town tomorrow for a workshop and talk at George Washington University and then [JupyterCon](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny) in NYC. So just in case I run out of time for new content this week, I thought I would repost an interview that I recently did with Jeff Young, formerly of the _Chronicle_ and now at EdSurge, that ranged over several topics including flipped learning and why higher education faculty are sometimes slow to adopt beneficial changes in teaching.

The audio of the interview is embedded below. [A partial transcript is at the original EdSurge post](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-08-08-lessons-from-flipped-classrooms-and-flipped-failures).
